# CS50 Web Programming - Social Media

### Description

This is a simple social media app created using Django and JavaScript. It was made as an assignment for Harvard's CS50 Web 
Programming with Python and JavaScript online course. It is a social media site that allows users to follow and unfollow other 
users, create posts, like and unlike posts, and edit posts. 

### Functionality

As described above, users can can create an account, sign in and out, follow other users and view their posts, create posts, edit 
their own posts, as well as like and unlike posts. The web app uses AJAX to asynchronously update the DOM with data from the 
database when liking/unliking posts, editing posts, and following/unfollowing users. This allows for a smoother user experience.
